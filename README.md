Hi there!

This is a raw repo of the codes I wrote to train an image classifier model for the AI Programming with Python course at Udacity. It's not fancy code but I am perfectly proud with what I have achieved after refreshing my rusty Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Python.

Happy to chat more if you are interested in this project!
